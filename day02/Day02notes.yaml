Operators:
  arithmetic --> + - / * % - mod
 
  / -->quotient
  % -->remainder

  logical operators - &&  ||
  ++ , -- 
  a=10;
  a++ -->a=a+1   -->postIncrement
  ++a -->preIncrement operator

  a--  -->post decrement
  --a  -->predecrement

  comparision operator -return boolean
   ==  
   <
   >
   <=
   >=
   !=

  strict equality  ===  check for datatype and value should be same
  non strict equality  == check the equality of value alone 
  -->return the boolean


  30==40  -->value 
  30 and 40 -->number and the value


-Conditional:
   loop Statements
    repeating same logic again and again until the condition the satisfies
    for 
    while
    do while

syntax :
  for(starting point,range of values, condition){}
String: sequence of character
 literal declaration
  let username="Vidya"
  let s1="Vidya"

new Keyword:
  let s2=new String("Vidya")
  let s3= new String("Vidya")

## Best Practices for Designing Framework

### 1.1 Modularity
- Break down the framework into smaller, reusable modules.
- Use components or classes that can be easily maintained and updated.
- Ensure each module has a single responsibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

### 1.2 Consistency
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and coding styles across the entire framework.
- Use a style guide to ensure uniformity in code structure and readability.
- Enforce consistency through code reviews and linting tools.

### 1.3 Documentation
- Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for all parts of the framework.
- Include code comments, API documentation, and usage examples.
- Regularly update documentation to reflect changes and improvements.

### 1.4 Testing
- Implement thorough testing to ensure reliability and catch potential bugs early.
- Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate.
- Consider Test-Driven Development (TDD) to improve code quality.

### 1.5 Scalability
- Design the framework with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth.
- Use design patterns that allow for easy extension and modification.
- Avoid hard-coding values; use configuration files or environment variables instead.

### 1.6 Performance
- Optimize the framework for performance and efficiency.
- Monitor performance metrics and refactor code to eliminate bottlenecks.
- Use caching and parallel execution where possible to improve speed.

### 1.7 Security
- Incorporate security best practices to protect data and functionality.
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Regularly review and update security protocols.

## Different Design Patterns

### 2.1 Singleton
- Ensures a class has only one instance.
- Used when a single instance is needed to coordinate actions across a system.
- Example: A configuration manager that loads settings from a file.

### 2.2 Factory
- Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- Useful for creating objects that follow a common interface but require different underlying implementations.
- Example: A shape factory that creates different types of shapes (circle, square) based on input.

### 2.3 Observer
- Allows objects to be notified of state changes.
- Useful for implementing event-driven systems where one change should notify multiple objects.
- Example: A UI component that updates when the underlying data model changes.

### 2.4 Decorator
- Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
- Used to extend the functionality of objects without modifying their structure.
- Example: Adding logging to a class method without altering the method itself.

### 2.5 Strategy
- Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- Useful for selecting algorithms at runtime without changing the underlying code.
- Example: A payment processing system that can switch between credit card, PayPal, and cryptocurrency payments.

### 2.6 Facade
- Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- Useful for hiding the complexity of subsystems from the client.
- Example: A facade for a home automation system that allows users to control lights, locks, and thermostats from a single interface.

## Page Object Model

### Overview
- The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation to create an object repository for web UI elements.
- It helps in maintaining and reusing code by separating the test scripts from the page elements.

### Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Changes in the UI require updates only in the page objects, not in the test scripts.
- **Reusability**: Page objects can be reused across multiple test cases.
- **Readability**: Tests become more readable and easier to understand by abstracting the UI interactions.

### Implementation
- Create a separate class for each web page or component.
- Define web elements as variables within the class using locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).
- Create methods to perform actions on the web elements (e.g., clicking a button, entering text).
- Example:
  ```javascript
  class LoginPage {
      constructor(page) {
          this.page = page;
          this.usernameField = page.locator('#username');
          this.passwordField = page.locator('#password');
          this.loginButton = page.locator('#loginButton');
      }

      async login(username, password) {
          await this.usernameField.fill(username);
          await this.passwordField.fill(password);
          await this.loginButton.click();
      }
  }
  ```

## Retry Tests in Playwright

### Description
Retrying tests in Playwright allows for automatic re-execution of failed tests, helping to improve test reliability and reduce flakiness.

### Implementation
To enable retries in Playwright, you can configure the `playwright.config.ts` file:

```javascript
export default defineConfig ({
  retries: 2, // Number of retry attempts
});
```

## Test Info

### Description
Test info in Playwright provides detailed information about the test execution, such as test title, status, error messages, and more.

### Usage
Access test info within your test using the `test.info()` method:

```javascript

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
  const testInfo = test.info();
  console.log(testInfo.title);
});
```

## Custom Fixture

### Description
Custom fixtures in Playwright allow you to set up and tear down resources that are needed for your tests.

### Implementation
Define custom fixtures:

```javascript
export const test = baseTest.extend({
    page: async ({page},use) =>{

       //Set up the fixture

        await use(page);
}
})
```

## Custom Reporters

### Description
Custom reporters in Playwright allow you to create your own formats for test result output.

### Implementation
Create a custom reporter by extending the `Reporter` class:

```javascript
class MyReporter {
  onBegin(config, suite) {
    console.log(`Starting the run with ${suite.allTests().length} tests`);
  }
  onTestEnd(test, result) {
    console.log(`Test ${test.title} finished with status: ${result.status}`);
  }
  onEnd(result) {
    console.log(`Finished the run: ${result.status}`);
  }
}

export{MyReporter} 
```
